During my high school years, I strongly disliked "Polish Language and Literature" classes. I thought they were boring and couldn't understand why poets and writers overthought and elaborated on even the simplest of things. Naturally, back then, I couldn't even fathom changing my mind. It is, therefore, very surprising to me that I now find myself not only enjoying reading short poems but also writing them, albeit terribly..

# How it started

As with most poets, I was trying to make something for a lady of mine that was meaningful, personal and coming from my heart.
Years ago, I did make two poems but the feedback about them was... not great. So much so, that I decided to hang up the pen for good.
Browsing the internet however, I stumbled upon [Haiku (俳句)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku) that I found particularly touching as
I've lost my grandparents a few years ago and they are still very much missed by me.

I think "Grandma" and forget (7)
You left in the spring       (5)
{% end %}

If you are unaware, Haiku is a type of short poetry that follows a 5-7-5 pattern of *morae(s)* - for english/polish these can be thought of as **syllables**.
To make truly traditional one, there are additional rules such as having one *kireji* (cutting word) and *kigo* (seasonal reference).
Obviously the one above did not have these, only the pattern itself. Notice as well that it does not need to rhyme.

There is also [Tanka (短歌, short poem)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanka) which also follows a specific pattern - 5-7-5-7-7. 
The 5-7-5 is known as *kami-no-ku* (upper phrase) and 7-7 is *shimo-no-ku* (lower phrase).

# My attempt 

Having read quite a few of them and about the history of it, I naively thought to myself "Doesn't seem hard, I think could do that".
To set the scene: I was in Italy on a winter skiing trip, having found myself stuck in our apartment due to bad weather. 
It's in Polish, so the Tanka structure (5-7-5-7-7) is only followed in Polish unfortunately, and not in it's English translation. 

{% quote() %}
Mgła gęsta mleczna        (5)
Białe bezkresne szczyty   (7)
Mroźny powiew zła         (5)
A ja trwam w stęsknieniu  (6)
Za ciepłem Twoich ramion  (7)
{% end %}

Which literal english translation is:

{% quote() %}
Dense milky mist 
White boundless peaks 
A frosty breath of evil 
And I persist in longing 
For the warmth of your arms
{% end %}


Unfortunately, as you can see, my snoozing-off during classes has reaped its fruit as I incorrectly counted syllables in "A ja trwam w stęsknieniu". 
I counted 'w' as a separate syllable, which brought the total to 7 (correct for Tanka). However, in Polish pronunciation, the preposition 'w' blends into the next word, meaning I actually only wrote 6 syllables. Skill issue..

The poem itself was sent like that before I caught on my mistake, so it is now frozen in time like so, with mistake in it.
From things that went well - it does have an upper phrase that sets the scene with seasonal reference and a lower phrase that comes out of the heart with a slightly melancholic yet hopeful tone - something I've been told is characteristic for Polish romantic poetry. The two are blended with a hook that contrasts warm and soft touch with cold hard ice.

> Funnily enough, I gave Gemini Pro the task to count the syllables and it also counted them incorrectly... Ah, AI will be a doom of mine at some point..

> And no, AI was not used in making this. That would defeat the whole idea of writing it from the heart.


# Other fun short poems

I've figured I will leave you out with some of the poems I found while doing a little rabbit hole jump.
First one is comedy that combines my love for computers:

All of the listed poems so far have been written by amateur writers. Just to showcase the difference,
here are two written by the pros:


_"Summer Moon"_ Tanka from book 'Poems in Exile' (1923) by Jun Fujita

{% quote() %}
The rain, crazed like horses
In the flare of lightning, has gone.

Against the clear washed sky
Rain-drops on the twigs
Reflect the moon.
{% end %} 

I think we can both agree that the image this poem draws is very vivid. I can almost hear the sound of the rain when reading that. Remarkable.


Unfortunately I do not know the title of this one, but I do know the author - American 19th century poet Emily Dickinson.

{% quote() %}
In this short Life
That only lasts an hour
How much - how little - is
Within our power
{% end %} 


So use your time wisely ;)
