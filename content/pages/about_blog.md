Welcome to my personal blog. My name is Michael, but on the internet, people know me as 'Revinder'.

I currently work as a `Backend Developer` in Python 🐍. In my free time, I tinker with Lua and Rust 🦀.

The blog unfortunately does not have a concrete structure of topics nor schedule as I write mostly about what interests me or
something surprising that I have learned and wish to memorise.

I also write book reviews from time to time, mostly as a way to ground what I have read as I found writing about it,
makes it stick better!
