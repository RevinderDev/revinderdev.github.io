My name is Michael. On the internet most people know me by 'Revinder' hence the name of this page. Sometimes I am grupmy, so excuse me my tone in some of the posts!

I'm mostly interested in:
* **IT related** topics - programming (snice this is my day job), but also embedded/systems, gamedev and webdev. Always fun to find exploits and dissect how they work. I also hold MSE in Computer Science.

* **Gaming/Esport** - specifically those that have competetive aspect to them, I've always was about pushing the limits and minimaxing everything. This allowed me to be on top of the game no matter the genre. Games are huge part of my life and I've played them since as long as I remember. Though I haven't found huge successes in my esport journey, I did try and compete on every opportunity. These are the titles that I spent majority of my time on:

    - World of Warcraft
    - League of Legends
    - Diablo 2
    - TFT

* **Movies/TV Series** - less than original but I can't help myself. I have always been drawn towards good shows and movies. If you have any hidden gems let me know! I keep scheduled list of what to watch next and given initial interest, I will add it to it! There is no limit to genre - it can be anything.

* **Music** - pretty much the same deal as movies and tv series ;).
