            <p>During my high school years, I strongly disliked "Polish Language and Literature" classes. I thought they were boring and couldn't understand why poets and writers overthought and elaborated on even the simplest of things. Naturally, back then, I couldn't even fathom changing my mind. It is, therefore, very surprising to me that I now find myself not only enjoying reading short poems but also writing them, albeit terribly..</p>

<h1 id="how-it-started">How it started</h1>
<p>As with most poets, I was trying to make something for a lady of mine that was meaningful, personal and coming from my heart.
Years ago, I did make two poems but the feedback about them was... not great. So much so, that I decided to hang up the pen for good.
Browsing the internet however, I stumbled upon <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku">Haiku (俳句)</a> that I found particularly touching as
I've lost my grandparents a few years ago and they are still very much missed by me.</p>
<div class="quote-shortcode">
    <p class="quote-text">Each time the phone rings    (5)
I think "Grandma" and forget (7)
You left in the spring       (5)</p>

<p>If you are unaware, Haiku is a type of short poetry that follows a 5-7-5 pattern of <em>morae(s)</em> - for english/polish these can be thought of as <strong>syllables</strong>.
To make truly traditional one, there are additional rules such as having one <em>kireji</em> (cutting word) and <em>kigo</em> (seasonal reference).
Obviously the one above did not have these, only the pattern itself. Notice as well that it does not need to rhyme.</p>
<p>There is also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanka">Tanka (短歌, short poem)</a> which also follows a specific pattern - 5-7-5-7-7.
The 5-7-5 is known as <em>kami-no-ku</em> (upper phrase) and 7-7 is <em>shimo-no-ku</em> (lower phrase).</p>
<h1 id="my-attempt">My attempt</h1>
<p>Having read quite a few of them and about the history of it, I naively thought to myself "Doesn't seem hard, I think could do that".
To set the scene: I was in Italy on a winter skiing trip, having found myself stuck in our apartment due to bad weather.
It's in Polish, so the Tanka structure (5-7-5-7-7) is only followed in Polish unfortunately, and not in it's English translation.</p>
<div class="quote-shortcode">
    <p class="quote-text">Mgła gęsta mleczna        (5)
Białe bezkresne szczyty   (7)
Mroźny powiew zła         (5)
A ja trwam w stęsknieniu  (6)
Za ciepłem Twoich ramion  (7)</p>
</div>
<p>Which literal english translation is:</p>
<div class="quote-shortcode">
    <p class="quote-text">Dense milky mist 
White boundless peaks 
A frosty breath of evil 
And I persist in longing 
For the warmth of your arms</p>
</div>
<p>Unfortunately, as you can see, my snoozing-off during classes has reaped its fruit as I incorrectly counted syllables in "A ja trwam w stęsknieniu".
I counted 'w' as a separate syllable, which brought the total to 7 (correct for Tanka). However, in Polish pronunciation, the preposition 'w' blends into the next word, meaning I actually only wrote 6 syllables. Skill issue..</p>
<p>The poem itself was sent like that before I caught on my mistake, so it is now frozen in time like so, with mistake in it.
From things that went well - it does have an upper phrase that sets the scene with seasonal reference and a lower phrase that comes out of the heart with a slightly melancholic yet hopeful tone - something I've been told is characteristic for Polish romantic poetry. The two are blended with a hook that contrasts warm and soft touch with cold hard ice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Funnily enough, I gave Gemini Pro the task to count the syllables and it also counted them incorrectly... Ah, AI will be a doom of mine at some point..</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And no, AI was not used in making this. That would defeat the whole idea of writing it from the heart.</p>

<p>I've figured I will leave you out with some of the poems I found while doing a little rabbit hole jump.
First one is comedy that combines my love for computers:</p>

<p>All of the listed poems so far have been written by amateur writers. Just to showcase the difference,
here are two written by the pros:</p>
<p><em>"Summer Moon"</em> Tanka from book 'Poems in Exile' (1923) by Jun Fujita</p>
<div class="quote-shortcode">
    <p class="quote-text">The rain, crazed like horses
In the flare of lightning, has gone.

Against the clear washed sky
Rain-drops on the twigs
Reflect the moon.</p>
</div>
<p>I think we can both agree that the image this poem draws is very vivid. I can almost hear the sound of the rain when reading that. Remarkable.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I do not know the title of this one, but I do know the author - American 19th century poet Emily Dickinson.</p>

That only lasts an hour
How much - how little - is

<p>So use your time wisely ;)</p>
